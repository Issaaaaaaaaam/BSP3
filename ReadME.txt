This is the ReadMe file for the 3rd semester BSP of Issam Jomaa.

In the Code folder are all the python files that a user can use to get the same results as the one presented in the scientific paper. 
	-dataset.py: contains all functions related to extracting data and pre-processing it.
	-Final_linear_regression: The user can use this file to get the same results as the one in the summary table.
	-generalised_linear_models: The user can use this files to get the summary of a generalised linear model model. 
	-linear_regression: This file contains all the functions we used to produce the 4 main linear regressions we showed in our scientific report. 
	-Plot: This file can be used to reproduce the graphs in the graph folder. This file takes in a special format of data that is not given in the sources files. 
	-predicted_R_squared: In this file we show how we calculate the predicted R squared for bot linear regressions and generalised linear models. 
	-Search_car_by_bank_id: One can show the plot of the car of a bank throughout time.
In the Data folder we can find the data we used both the raw and the Log one. 

In the Results folder we have the main results that we showed in our report. 

The graph folder contains the graph we produced.
